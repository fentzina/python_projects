# Python Projects

During my studies, I was not taught Python or R at all. So, after my graduation I decided that I am going to teach myself python because of its potentials and flexibility. My goal is to become confident enough to build ML and CV projects using python.

This is a series of little projects that I have implemented in order to improve my skills in python.
Feel free to use them or contact me to share your ideas or alternative solutions about each topic!
